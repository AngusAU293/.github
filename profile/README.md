# Welcome to my profile!
My name is HackerSploit, I'm a -10x developer (takes ten devs to fix my work).

I've been coding for the past 3 years or so...
A lot of my stuff here are work in progresses, so don't get too exited.

Anyway, not much else to cover I guess.

Please feel free to take a look at some of my projects!
